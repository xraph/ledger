description: Human-emulating AI agent orchestration for Go.
---

Cortex is a Go library for building AI agents that think and behave like humans. Instead of hand-crafting system prompts, you declare an agent's **skills**, **traits**, **behaviors**, and **persona** — the same building blocks that make people unique — and Cortex assembles them into a coherent identity at runtime.

Cortex is a **library** — not a service. You bring your own LLM provider, database, and HTTP server. Cortex provides the agent orchestration plumbing.

## The Human Model

Cortex models AI agents the way you would describe a person:

| Aspect | What it represents | Go type |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Skill** | What the agent can do (capabilities + tools) | `skill.Skill` |
| **Trait** | Who the agent is (personality dimensions) | `trait.Trait` |
| **Behavior** | What the agent does habitually (trigger → action) | `behavior.Behavior` |
| **Cognitive Style** | How the agent thinks (phase-based reasoning) | `cognitive.Style` |
| **Communication Style** | How the agent talks (tone, formality, verbosity) | `communication.Style` |
| **Perception** | How the agent sees (attention filters) | `perception.Model` |
| **Persona** | The whole person (composes all of the above) | `persona.Persona` |

## What it does

- **Declarative personality** — Define agents via composable Skills, Traits, and Behaviors instead of imperative prompt engineering.
- **Persona composition** — Bundle skills, traits, behaviors, cognitive style, communication style, and perception into a reusable Persona. Assign it to any agent with one field.
- **Execution tracking** — Every agent run is recorded as a Run with Steps and ToolCalls, providing full observability into reasoning chains.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Checkpoints pause a run for human approval before proceeding with sensitive actions.
- **Multi-tenant isolation** — Every entity is scoped to a tenant and app via context. Cross-tenant access is structurally impossible.
- **Plugin system** — 16 lifecycle hooks for metrics, audit trails, tracing, and custom processing. Extensions opt in to only the events they care about.
- **Memory management** — Conversation history, working memory, and summary memory per agent per tenant.
- **PostgreSQL store** — Production-ready persistence with embedded migrations and JSONB columns for flexible metadata.
- **Forge integration** — Drop-in `forge.Extension` with DI-injected Engine and auto-registered HTTP routes.
- **REST API** — 36 endpoints for managing agents, personas, skills, traits, behaviors, runs, checkpoints, and memory.

## Design philosophy

**Library, not service.** Cortex is a set of Go packages you import. You control `main`, the database connection, and the process lifecycle.

**Declarative over imperative.** You don't tell agents what to do — you tell them who they are. Skills define capabilities, Traits shape personality, Behaviors encode habits. Cortex assembles the system prompt and runtime parameters from these declarations.

**Interfaces over implementations.** Every subsystem defines a Go interface. Swap any storage backend with a single type change.

**Tenant-scoped by design.** `cortex.WithTenant` and `cortex.WithApp` inject context that is enforced at every layer.

**TypeID everywhere.** All entities use type-prefixed, K-sortable, UUIDv7-based identifiers (`agt_`, `skl_`, `trt_`, `bhv_`, `prs_`, `arun_`, etc.).

## Quick look

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"

    "github.com/xraph/cortex/engine"
    "github.com/xraph/cortex/extension"
    "github.com/xraph/cortex/store/postgres"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()

    // Create the store.
    db := connectDB() // your *bun.DB
    pgStore := postgres.New(db)

    // Build the Cortex engine.
    eng, err := engine.New(
        engine.WithStore(pgStore),
    )
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Or use as a Forge extension:
    ext := extension.New(
        extension.WithStore(pgStore),
    )
    _ = ext // register with your Forge app
    _ = eng
    _ = ctx
}
```
